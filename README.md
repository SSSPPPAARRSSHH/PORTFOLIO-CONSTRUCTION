# PORTFOLIO-CONSTRUCTION
PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
Portfolio Construction
I have done risk-return comparison and portfolio performance evaluation
of three different portfolios created using the five stocks(BSE) based on fundamental analysis.
Data Requirements:

a. any 5 stocks.
b. CLOSING price data for eight years of all the 5 stocks.
c. Computed return keeping one year holding period into account and standard
deviation for all the five stocks
d. Created covariance and correlation matrix for all the five stocks (5 * 5 matrix)

Portfolio Analysis:
a) Created three portfolios: (Each of the three portfolios have all 5 stocks in it.)
i) Portfolio 1: each stock with equal weight
ii) Two more Portfolios: any weight structure (different from above)
iii) No share will have a weight of 100 or 0 (Zero).
b) Computed portfolio return and risk for each portfolio
Portfolio Selection Rationale Requirements:
a. Policy statement of investor defined in terms of target return and acceptable risk.
b. Reason for selecting the weights for portfolio creation?
Interpretation Requirements:
a. Does changing weights of stocks in portfolio impact portfolio return and risk?
b. Degree of impact (compare risk and return of different portfolios)?
c. Comment on the different degree of diversification present in these three different
portfolios.
